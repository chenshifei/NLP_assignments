\section{Survey Proposal}

I would like to have a look on word disambiguation, especially for words being used to avoid censorship.

I have enclosed three articles with my proposal\cite{knockel2018effect}
\cite{ji2018creative}\cite{ng2018linguistic}. In fact they were all discussed during the workshop on Natural Language Processing for Internet Freedom\cite{brew2018proceedings}.
